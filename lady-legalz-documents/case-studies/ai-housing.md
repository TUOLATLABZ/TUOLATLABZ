# Case Study: AI-Powered Legal Intake for Housing Evictions – Stanford Legal Design Lab

## Overview
Stanford's Legal Design Lab developed a prototype AI Intake Agent (2024-2025) for legal aid organizations, automating client screening for eviction/housing issues using rules-based + generative AI.

## Key Features
- Collects client info via chat/voice.
- Integrates with case management (e.g., LegalServer).
- High-impact: Reduces intake time while maintaining accuracy.

## Outcomes
- Improved efficiency: Frees staff for complex cases.
- Ethical focus: Accessibility (multilingual, screen-reader compatible), no legal advice given.
- Evaluation: Positive feedback on fairness and integration.

## Lessons for Legal Tech
- Hybrid AI (rules + LLMs) for reliability.
- Judicial Process
- Relevance to TUOLAT LABZ: Prototype similar tools for digital judicial access.
