# Case Study: AI Hallucinations in Legal Research – Mata v. Avianca (2023) and Stanford Benchmark

## Overview
In high-profile incidents, lawyers using tools like ChatGPT, Lexis+ AI, and Westlaw AI cited non-existent cases, leading to sanctions. A Stanford HAI study (2024) tested over 200 queries and found hallucinations in 1 out of 6 benchmark queries on commercial legal AI tools.

## Key Issues
- Fabricated citations (e.g., invented precedents in bankruptcy or abortion law post-Dobbs).
- Risks: Undue trust in AI outputs leading to erroneous judgments.
- Real Case: New York lawyer sanctioned for fake cases generated by ChatGPT.

## Lessons for Legal Tech
- Need for grounded retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
- Importance of human oversight and verification tools.
- Relevance to TUOLAT LABZ: Develop hallucination-detection prototypes.
