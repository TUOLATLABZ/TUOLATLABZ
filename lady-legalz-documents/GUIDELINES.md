# Guidelines for "Lady Legalz" Documents Folder in TUOLAT LABZ

**Welcome to the Lady Legalz Documents Hub!** 👩‍⚖️✨  
This folder is dedicated to **Lady Legalz** — our empowering initiative within TUOLAT LABZ that celebrates women in legal tech, innovation, and justice. Drawing from TUOLAT's mission to pioneer legal education and build a Digital Judicial System, Lady Legalz focuses on resources, templates, and guides tailored for female students, professionals, and innovators in law and technology.

**Folder Structure Overview**  
Organize documents here for easy access and collaboration. Use subfolders to keep things tidy:
- `templates/` — Ready-to-use legal document templates (e.g., contracts, writs, motions).
- `guides/` — Step-by-step tutorials and best practices (e.g., AI in legal research, ethical tech use).
- `case-studies/` — Real-world examples and anonymized cases highlighting women's contributions to legal innovation.
- `resources/` — PDFs, articles, and links (e.g., HUD regulations, Fourteenth Amendment analyses).
- `personal-projects/` — Individual uploads for Lady Legalz members (prefix files with your initials, e.g., `EJS_MotionDraft.docx`).

## Key Guidelines for Using and Contributing

1. **Naming Conventions**  
   - Use clear, descriptive names: e.g., `Motion_for_Writ_of_Mandamus_Compensatory_Damages_Template.docx`.  
   - Include dates for versions: `YYYY-MM-DD_FileName_VersionX.ext`.  
   - Avoid spaces; use hyphens or underscores. No special characters.  
   - Prefix sensitive files with `[CONFIDENTIAL]` (e.g., `[CONFIDENTIAL]_EIV_Report_Analysis.pdf`).

2. **File Types and Best Practices**  
   - Preferred formats: `.md` (Markdown for guides), `.docx`/`.pdf` (legal docs), `.py` (tech scripts if related).  
   - Keep files under 10MB; compress large PDFs.  
   - Add metadata: Include a header in docs with author, date, purpose (e.g., "Drafted by Lady Legalz Member - For TUOLAT JD Tech Program").  
   - Version control: Use Git branches for major edits (e.g., `git checkout -b lady-legalz-update-motion`).

3. **Contribution Rules**  
   - **Fork & Pull Request Workflow**: Don't edit directly—fork the repo, make changes in your branch, then submit a PR with a clear description (e.g., "Added template for immigration fraud statutes reference").  
   - Review process: At least one other Lady Legalz member or Innovation Lab admin must approve.  
   - Cite sources: For legal refs (e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 1546 on fraud), link to official sources like Cornell LII.  
   - Inclusivity: All content must promote diversity, equity, and respect—focus on empowering women in law/tech.

4. **Security & Confidentiality**  
   - Mark sensitive docs as private (use GitHub's file-level restrictions if needed).  
   - No real client data: Anonymize everything.  
   - Report issues: Use GitHub Issues for bugs or suggestions (label as "lady-legalz-docs").

5. **Tools & Integration**  
   - Link to TUOLAT resources: Embed links to [tuolatjuris.org](https://eshawnscip.wixsite.com/tuolatjuris) or Innovation Lab email.  
   - Collaborate: Share via Discord/Slack channels for Lady Legalz discussions.  
   - Update regularly: Review quarterly for 2026 relevance (e.g., add AI ethics guidelines).
